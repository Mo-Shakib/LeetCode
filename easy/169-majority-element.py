# Testcase Example:  '[3,2,3]'
#
# Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
# 
# The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You
# may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [3,2,3]
# Output: 3
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
# Output: 2
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# n == nums.length
# 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
# -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
# 
# 
# 
# Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?
#

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums = sorted(nums)
        return nums[len(nums)//2]

# Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.
# 
# A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
# 
# 
# Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the
# squares of its digits.
# Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it
# loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
# Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
# 
# 
# Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 19
# Output: true
# Explanation:
# 1^2 + 9^2 = 82
# 8^2 + 2^2 = 68
# 6^2 + 8^2 = 100
# 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 2
# Output: false
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
#
